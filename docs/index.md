# Introduction {-}

This is a list of R resources, links and tips that is being curated to help particularly with training on the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) and working efficiently in R. A good place to get started with learning about R is the [PHI Introduction to R in NSS](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/R-Resources/blob/master/Intro%20to%20R-NSS.md). If you want to try out R without installing it, you can do this on [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud).  
  
For the tidyverse section, I provide a recommended order to work through materials for training. However, it is, of course, not necessary to follow this exactly â€“ particularly if you feel you are already comfortable with some of the material. I leave it to the reader/participant to use this as they see fit.  
  
I am very grateful to [Sean Kross](https://twitter.com/seankross) for providing a simple-to-use [bookdown template](https://github.com/seankross/bookdown-start) to get me started, and of course, [Yihui Xie](https://twitter.com/xieyihui) for creating the fantastic [bookdown](https://bookdown.org) package.  
  
Finally, this is a work-in-progress and will need updating over time. Therefore, if you have suggestions, comments or feedback, please get in touch.
